Û∞≠∑ Introduction ü•¨
=================

This manual should provide all the information needed to begin using _Zelkata_'s most basic (though hopefully still very
useful) functionality quickly and painlessly, through to utilising more complex features, options, & workflows with
just a little practice and confidence with not just how the system works, but how it works _for you_.

If you find any aspects of it confusing, overly vague, overly technical, or otherwise difficult to follow from those
first steps to reaching a point where it's working well for you, please don't hesitate for a second to open a issue at
the
[Óôõ GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/omnikron13/Zelkata/issues/)
for the project explaining your issues.

???+ note
     Further (less formal) areas to discus issues, ideas, problems, etc. will be made available in time


## Û∞≠∂ Overview

If this if your first encounter with _Zelkata_, you are likely to have quite a few questions regarding what it _is_,
what if is _for_, where it came from. Not to mention _how_ exactly it is to benefit _you_.

_Zelkata_ is, or ultimately aims to be, a tool (or perhaps more accurately tool-box, or even tool-_shed_) for
note-taking, inspiration provoking, project visualisation, development, and refinement.

Getting started should seem dubiously easy and simplistic ü§î, improving your confidence and productivity should prove
gradual yet satisfying üôÇ‚Äç, and eventually finding it nigh indispensable should manifest unassumingly as an
emergent property ü•¨ü´®ü•¨.

On the other hand, it may utterly clash with with the way your brain naturally prefers to process information, or that
 you have tirelessly trained yourself to think and work in a very different way ü§®.


## Û∞øÄ Etymology

I kept confusing the term _Zettelk√§sten_; switching *Z*s, *K*s, & *T*s.
I'm not even entirely sure I can pronounce the word, let alone reliably remember and spell it; something of an issue
when one is taking something of an interest in a subject.

I dropped some letters, swapped out the _-en_ ending which both made it a touch less Germanic and less ambiguous in
pronunciation.

_'Kata'_ also has the serendipitous meaning of a (generally) solo practiced form.


## Û∞≠∞ History

The delightfully German system of _Zettelk√§sten_ is, most directly, the influence behind this project.
The term itself translates to _'note boxes'_ or _'card boxes'_, and as you might guess they are essentially forms of
_card catalogue_.

Many may doggedly defend a favoured 'inventor' of these systems, though they have a long and rich history across the
world, varying by one degree or another depending on their precise purposes.

Specifics aside, the principle of a card catalogue represents a shift from storing & presenting information in a
_linear_ manner (as in e.g. a book), to employing some manner of _data structure_ (tree, graph, etc.) to allow for more
flexible access and presentation of information.

The prototypical _Zettelk√§sten_ system stores information on myriad individual physical cards, which have categories
associated with them, creating a web or graph of information that can be explored in a non-linear manner.
This structure bears similarity to how the brain stores and retrieves information, and so can be a very effective
extension of one's own memory and thought processes if used effectively.

Effective use is made many times easier by the use of a computer based system to manage the creation, storage,
categorisation, and retrieval of notes.
This is where _Zelkata_ (along with a number of other available systems) comes in, aiming to provide a set of flexible
and extensible tools to manage and curate a digital _Zettelk√§sten_ type system of your own.


## Û∞≠∑ Enough waffle! How and why?

You write many short, specific _Û±üó notes_, each about a single thing.

You add _ÔÄ´ tags_ to the notes to sort and categorise them.

The software does the rest, combining related notes together for you, providing both overviews of specific subjects,
categories, projects, etc. for you, but also allows you to explore relations that you may very well not have considered
when you were making the notes.

There is, of course, somewhat more to it than that (or will be, though don't worry; mostly more for the _system_,
not _too_ much more for you).
