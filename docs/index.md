ó°­· Introduction ðŸ¥¬
=================

This manual should provide all the information needed to begin using Zelkata's most basic (though hopefully still very
useful) functionality quickly and painlessly, through to utilising more complex features, options, & workflows with
just a little practice and confidence with not just how the system works, but how it works _for you_.

If you find any aspects of it confusing, overly vague, overly technical, or otherwise difficult to follow from those
first steps to reaching a point where it's working well for you, please don't hesitate for a second to open a issue at:

 - [The GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/omnikron13/Zelkata/issues/) for the project explaining your issues.

??? note
    Further (less formal) areas to discus issues, ideas, problems, etc. will be made available in time


## Overview

If this if your first encounter with _Zelkata_, you are likely to have quite a few questions regarding what it _is_,
what if is _for_, where it came from. Not to mention _how_ exactly it is to benefit _you_.

??? warning "TODO:"
    List out the basic history of _Zettelkasten_, card catalogues, etc. (in brief, referencing out details).
    Note the emphasis on capturing small & atomic pieces of information you have learned, passing thoughts & ideas, etc.
    Briefly compare the notably different methodology between more traditional hierarchical note taking, vs. the
    seemingly chaotic & disorganised methods such as Zettelkasten.
    Spring the twist that these seemingly disjoined short notes are annotated with simple tags, creating a web of
    information that can be reviewed and collated in remarkably flexible ways.
    Note that this does not, however necessarily line up well with the diversity of human brains, and the way
    they have developed experience and confidence in working; it is not necessarily a system for everyone.
    
    (Potentially draw paralleles to how the human brain and it's thought processes often work more by association
    and concetps which my not be as apparent working with more rigid top-down or bottom-up data. This should
    probably be mosty elaborated in follwoing sub-seactions/headedings below the top-level bultted list.)
