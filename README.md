🗃️ Zelkata 🥬
============

Zelkata is, or ultimately aims to be, a tool (or perhaps more accurately tool-box, or even tool-*shed*) for
note-taking, inspiration provoking, project visualisation, development, and refinement.

Getting started should seem dubiously easy and simplistic 🤔, improving your confidence and productivity should prove
gradual yet satisfying 🙂‍, and eventually finding it nigh indispensable should manifest unassumingly as an
emergent property 🥬🫨🥬.

On the other hand, it may utterly clash with with the way your brain naturally prefers to process information, or that
 you have tirelessly trained yourself to think and work in a very different way 🤨.


## 📇 Etymology 🇩🇪

I kept confusing the term *Zettelkästen*; switching Zs, Ks, & Ts.
I'm not even entirely sure I can pronounce the word, let alone reliably remember and spell it; something of an issue
when one is taking something of an interest in a subject.

I dropped some letters, swapped out the *-en* ending which both made it a touch less Germanic and less ambiguous in
pronunciation.

'*Kata*' also has the serendipitous meaning of a (generally) solo practiced form.


## 🗄️History 🗂️

The delightfully German system of *Zettelkästen* is, most directly, the influence behind this project.
The term itself translates to *'note boxes'* or *'card boxes'*, and as you might guess were essentially forms of
*card catalogue*.
Many may doggedly defend a favourite 'inventor' of these systems, though they have a long and rich history across the
world, varying a by a degree or another depending on their precise purposes.


### 📝 Enough waffle! How and why? 🏷️

You write many short, specific notes about a single thing.
You add tags to the notes to sort and categorise them.
The software does the rest, combining related notes together for you, providing both overviews of specific subjects,
categories, projects, etc. for you, but also allows you to explore relations that you may very well not have considered
when you were making the notes.

There is, of course, somewhat more to it than that (or will be, though don't worry; for the *system*, not so much for
*you*).

For more details, you should review [The Manual 📖](https://Omnikron13/github.io/Zelkata).
